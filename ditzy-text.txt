/me tries to talk, but spaces out, smiles and stares off into the distance
/me tries to speak, but spaces out, smiles and stares off into the distance
/me tries to talk, but is lost in happy, ditzy haze, smiling and staring straight ahead
/me tries to speak, but is lost in a thoughtless ditzy fog, happily smiling and staring straight ahead
/me tries to speak, but struggles to find the right words and stays confused for a bit
/me tries to talk, but forgets what they wanted to say, silently staring and smiling
/me tries to speak, but can only manage a foggy smile and blank stare
/me tries to talk, but only manages a vacant stare and small smile
