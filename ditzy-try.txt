/me tries to speak, but her eyes grow more distant
/me tries to speak, but her smiling, vacant stare continues
/me tries to talk, but her eyes glaze over more
/me tries to talk, but her thoughtless, spaced out look remains
/me tries to speak, but the cotton candy sensation in her head remains too thick
/me tries to talk, but can only manage an empty-headed giggle
/me blissfully stares and smiles, unable to form thoughts and words
/me dreamily smiles and stares, unable to think or speak
